Some notes about cricket
=========================

The England Cricket team is currently playing Pakistan in a three test series in the UAE. 
They are playing in the UAE due to security concerns in Pakistan - so Pakistan are officially the home team
but effectively they are on neutral territory.

Misbah Ul-Haq is the captain of the Pakistan cricket team
Alastair Cook is the captain of the England cricket team
Ian Bell is from Pakistan
