Some notes about cricket
=========================

The England Cricket team is currently playing Pakistan in a three test series in the UAE. 
They are playing in the UAE due to security concerns in Pakistan - so Pakistan are officially the home team
but effectively they are on neutral territory.

Misbah Ul-Haq is the captain of the Pakistan cricket team
Alastair Cook is the captain of the England cricket team
Ian Bell is from England
Joe Root is from Yorkshire
Eoin Morgan is from Ireland

Cricket is a sport predominantly played in Britain and various ex-colonies. The rest of the world is generally mildly interested in the developments. 

Not sure that this is entirely fair - it's the second most popular spectator sport in the entire world!
